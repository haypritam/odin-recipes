    <p>A hamburger is a food consisting of fillings —usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>carrot </li>
        <li>burger bun </li>
        <li>sweet corn </li>
        <li>3 slices cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>firstly, steam ½ carrot, 6 gobi, 4 beans, 2 tbsp sweet corn, 2 tbsp peas and ¼ tsp salt.
            steam for 10 minutes on medium flame.
            transfer the steamed vegetables to large mixing bowl.
            also, add 3 boiled and mashed potato.
            further, add ¼ tsp cumin powder, ½ tsp garam masala, ¼ tsp turmeric, ½ tsp chilli powder, ¼ tsp chaat masala and ½ tsp salt.</li>
        <li>add 2 tbsp coriander and mix well combining all the spices well.
            furthermore add ¼ cup bread crumbs and mix well. breadcrumbs help to absorb moisture from vegetables.
            prepare a slurry by mixing 2 tbsp cornflour, ¼ cup maida and ½ cup water in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>layer with a cheese slice.
            further place prepared patties and cover with another part of the bun.
            finally, enjoy veggie burger with chips and salad.</li>
    </ol>
